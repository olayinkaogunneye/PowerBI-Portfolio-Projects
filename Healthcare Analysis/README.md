In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority.
In this Power BI case study, which I completed through DataCamp, I explored a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat. 

I analyzed attributes impacting the patient Length of Stay (LOS) and cost, and identified factors contributing to hospital differences. I leveraged my DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations.

To finish off, I brought it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team. This case study gave me a chance to practice a range of Power BI skills, working with real-world data provided by DataCamp.
A special thank you to DataCamp for providing this practical and engaging case study experience, helping me enhance my Power BI and data analysis skills.
